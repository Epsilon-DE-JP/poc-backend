# Setup & Running
To run a Node.js project, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your Node.js project using the `cd` command. For example, if your project is located in a directory called "myproject," you would use the command `cd myproject`.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the command `npm install`. This will read the `package.json` file in your project and install any dependencies that are listed there.
4. Run the Node.js project by using the command `npm start`. This will start the application and execute the script defined in the package.json file under the `"scripts"` property with the `"start"` key.
